In her search for comfortable, functional and stylish maternity and nursing wear, it appeared hitting all three was the trifecta that didn’t exist. She was disheartened to find that in becoming a mother, she’d inadvertently have to give up her own sense of personal style. Suddenly in this new role, she was being forced into this one-size-fits-all mould of how a mother should look—and it wasn’t pretty. And who on earth said you couldn’t look gorgeous whilst breastfeeding, was that such a crime? In 2007, apparently, it was. She wanted more and realised that if she felt this way, so must many other women across the world.<\/p><p>This became her driving force to create beautiful, high quality, functional and comfortable pieces that help to support mothers on their breastfeeding journey. From our humble beginnings, operating out of a Sydney garage to being stocked around the globe, it’s safe to say she was right.<\/p><p>To this day, Tracey has that same passion and vision driving her, encouraging women to breastfeed for as long as possible in a supported & educated community.<\/p>",
